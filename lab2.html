                            I've been collecting Records and Tapes for nearly 20 years now, 
                            mostly punk, and some metal and reggae. I have lots of rare games,
                            lots of common jammer and loads and loads of demo tapes I've gotten over the years.

                            I've been working, for the most part anyway, in web since 2014. Most of my career thus
                            far has been limited to graphic design work and wordpress & drupal development. During the pandemic I was laid off
                            and I decided to start learning some new sutff. I taught myself several additional programming languages
                            and after a year of solo-study I decided to enroll at Langara, where I have been for the past year.
